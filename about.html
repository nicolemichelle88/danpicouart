      <p class="about_the_artist">
        Born and raised in Lafayette, Lousiana, Daniel Picou took to art at a young age. As a high school student, he would create flash animations, simple video games, and comics of himself and his friends embarking on adventures and fighting enemies in their school and local neighborhoods to keep himself entertained. After high school, he attended graphic design classes, but found it just wasn't giving him the same level of fulfillment that drawing always had. In his twenties, he began to practice anatomy and figure drawing more seriously, studying under acclaimed Disney artist, Glenn Vilppu. For the last decade, Daniel has worked tirelessly and dedicated himself to his work in order to become a better artist and to bring the worlds in his imagination to life.
        <br />
        <br />
        He currently resides in Austin, Texas, with his girlfriend Nicole and their two mischeivous mutts, Scout and Charlie.
